1. Getting a error message is not a bad thing
2. Using google as a source of help is a good thing if used correctly
1. I am going to try to use my keyboard commands more when navigating my key board
2.I will also try to use the slack more if I find myself stuck.
SHOUTOUT to Ngoc for helping me get the confidence I need and just being a positive person.
